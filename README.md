# Aim
Its about a.i.

Instructions:

Windows:

I made batch files to run without Docker
run
install-deps.bat
get-llama.bat
Put any gguf in models folder
run-services.sh

Something like 
https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF?show_file_info=Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
which is < 1gb should work.



I prefer https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF?show_file_info=Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_M.gguf

Linux:

Docker compose should sitll work. I'm working on a docker-less solution.
compose file should change the model params.
