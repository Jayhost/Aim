# Aim
Its about a.i.

Instructions:
The project now runs using Docker Compose. 
Place a model in the models folder.
docker-compose up should pull and run.

I'm using this model at the moment.

For a different model the docker-compose.yml file should be changed to reflect.
/models/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_S.gguf
